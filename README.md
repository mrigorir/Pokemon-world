- Copy the project URL as displayed on HTTPS tab

- If you're running Windows Operating System, open your command prompt. On Linux, Open your terminal

- Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made. Leave as it is if the current location is where you want the project to be.

### Github Actions

To make sure the linters' checks using Github Actions work properly, you should follow the next steps:

1. On your recently forked repo, enable the GitHub Actions in the Actions tab.
   
2. Create the `feature/branch` and push.
   
3. Start working on your milestone as usual.
   
4. Open a PR from the `feature/branch` when your work is done.

### Usage 

- Make sure you have npm and node installed in your terminal.

- I recommend the use of VS code as a code editor, but you can use whatever you want.

- Run in your terminal `npm run start` to see webpack html file in action.

- Run `npm install express` in case you get the error after running the server.

- You can see the pokemons cards when the page loads. 

- If you click the `info` button, you can see the profile, and post a comment.

- You can click the `heart` button to leave your like.
